<h3>Oversample Operator</h3>
<p>This operator upsamples a real of complex image by zero-padding in
the frequency domain. The algorithm takes into account the value of the
Doppler Centroid Frequency
when padding the azimuth spectrum. For real image, the upsampled image
is also a real
image, and for complex image, the up sampled image is a complex image.
<br></p>
<h4>Oversampled Image Size</h4><p>
User can select the output image size by selecting
</p><ul>
<li>the user specified output image dimension, or</li>
<li>the row, column ratios by which the input image should be multiplied, or</li>
<li>in terms of output image range and azimuth pixel spacings.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Parameters Used<br></h4><p>
If the upsampled image is output by image size, then the following parameters are
used by the operator:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Source Bands: All bands (real or virtual) of the source product. User can
select one or more bands for producing upsampled images. If no bands are
selected, then by default all bands are selected.</li>
<li>Output Image By: The method for determining upsampled image dimension.</li>
<li> Output Image Rows: The row size of the upsampled image.</li>
<li> Output Image Columns: The column size of the upsampled image.</li>
</ol>

<p>
If the upsampled image is output by image dimension ratio, then the following
parameters are used by the operator:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Source Bands: All bands (real or virtual) of the source product. User can
select one or more bands for producing upsampled images. If no bands are
selected, then by default all bands are selected.</li>
<li>Output Image By: The method for determining upsampled image dimension.</li>
<li> Width Ratio: The ratio of the upsampled image width and the source image width.</li>
<li> Height Ratio: The ratio of the upsampled image height and the source image height.</li>
</ol>

<p>
If the upsampled image is output by pixel spacing, then the following parameters are
used by the operator:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Source Bands: All bands (real or virtual) of the source product. User can
select one or more bands for producing upsampled images. If no bands are
selected, then by default all bands are selected.</li>
<li>Output Image By: The method for determining upsampled image dimension.</li>
<li> Range Spacing: The range pixel spacing of the upsampled image.</li>
<li> Azimuth Spacing: The azimuth pixel spacing of the upsampled image.</li>
</ol>
