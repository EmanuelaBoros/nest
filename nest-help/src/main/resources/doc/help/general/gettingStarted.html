<h3>NEST Version 3C</h3>



<h4>Overview</h4>


<p>The Next ESA SAR Toolbox (NEST) is used for reading,
post-processing, analyzing and visualizing the large archive of data
from ESA SAR missions including ERS1 &amp; 2,
ENIVSAT and eventually Sentinel-1, as well as third party SAR-data from JERS SAR,
ALOS PALSAR, TerraSAR-X, Radarsat-1 and Radarsat-2. NEST will help the
remote sensing community by handling ESA SAR products and complimenting
existing commercial packages.</p>


<p>The main components of the NEST are:</p>

<ul>

    <li>DAT - A desktop application used for EO data visualisation, analysing and processing.</li>
  <li>A rich collection of readers and writers to allow easy and
effficient access to SAR data, abstracted interanl representation and
output to common formats for compatibility with other software.</li>

    <li>A set of scientific data processors running either from the command line or invoked by DAT.</li>

    <li>A powerful and flexible graph processing framework to allow you to create you own processing chains.<br>


    </li>

    <li>A Java&#8482; API which provides ready-to-use components for remote sensing related application
        development and plug-in points for new NEST extension modules.
    </li>

</ul>


<h4>Supported Product Formats</h4>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;NEST&nbsp;includes readers for the following data products:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENVISAT ASAR,&nbsp;MERIS, AATSR</li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ERS AMI 1 &amp; 2 (CEOS &amp; Envisat format)</li>
  <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; JERS SAR</li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radarsat 1&nbsp;</li>
  <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; DIMAP</li>
  <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; GETASSE30 DEM</li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ACE DEM</li>
</ul>
<p>Information about access to these products
    is given on the <a href="BeamDataSources.html">Data Sources page</a>.</p>
<p><br>
An API is provided with NEST to allow easy extension by users to add
data ingestion of other formats and to support data formats of future
missions.</p>
<h4>Source Code</h4>


<p>The complete NEST software has been developed under the GNU public license
    and comes with full source code in Java<sup>TM</sup>.</p>


<h4>Supported Platforms</h4>


<p>NEST is programmed in pure Java&#8482; to allow a maximum
portability. The NEST software has been successfully tested under MS
Windows&#8482;&nbsp;XP<sup>®</sup>
    as well as under Linux and Solaris<sup>®</sup>; operating systems. NEST will be available for Mac OS X as soon as Apple supports the
    J2SE 6 platform.</p>
