<h3>Coregistering&nbsp;Products</h3>
NEST performs coregistration automatically by maximizing correlation in
windows around&nbsp;Ground Control Points (GCPs).<br>
This allows pixel-by-pixel comparisons of&nbsp;multiple datasets
that cover the same region.<br><br>Images
may be fully or only partly overlapping and may be from acquisitions
taken at different times using multiple sensors or from multiple
passages of the<br>same satellite.<br>
<br>
Image co-registration is fundamental for Interferometry SAR (InSAR)
imaging and its applications, such as DEM map generation and analysis.
To obtain a high quality InSAR image, the individual complex images
need to be co-registered to sub-pixel accuracy. <br><br>
Coregistration is achieved in NEST using two graphs, one for GCP
Selection and the other to apply the Warp.<br>
<br>
<h4>GCP Selection</h4>
The GCP Selection graph uses the <a href="../operators/CollocateOp.html">Collocate</a> and <a href="../operators/GCPSelectionOp.html">GCP Selection</a> operators.<br><br><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img style="width: 421px; height: 144px;" alt="gcp selection graph" src="images/gcp_selection_graph.jpg"><br></div><br>
1. Create a new project for your coregistered data products.<br>
2. Open a product as the master and produce a subset of it for the
desired area of interest.<br>
3. Open the master product and from the <a href="../visat/GcpManagement.html">GCP Manager</a> enter a grid of
evenly spaced GCPs and save the product.<br>
4. Open a list of slave products which overlap the master area of
interest.<br>
5. From the Graph menu open the GCP Selection graph.<br>
6. Drag and drop the master product from the project tree to the source
entry of the Reader<br>
7. Drag and drop the slave products from the project tree to the
ProductSet Reader<br>
8. Press Process to begin the GCP Selection graph<br>
9. You may open the resulting GCP selected slave images and view/modify
the GCPs that have been shifted in the slaves.<br>
<h4>Warp Application</h4>
The Warp graph uses the <a href="../operators/WarpOp.html">Warp</a> operator.<br><br><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img style="width: 364px; height: 139px;" alt="warp graph" src="images/warp_graph.jpg"><br></div><br>
1. From the Graph menu open the Warp graph<br>
2. Drag and drop the master product from the project tree to the source
entry of the Reader<br>
3. Drag and drop the gcp selected slave products from the project tree
to the ProductSet Reader<br>
4. Press Process to begin the Warp graph<br>
<br>
Note: Coregistration is currently only available for detected products.
Coregistration of complex products will be available in the next
release of the software.<br>
