<h3>Coregistering a Product</h3>





<br>Coregistration is achieved in NEST using two graphs, one for GCP Selection and the other to apply the Warp.<br><br><h4>GCP Selection</h4><br>1. Create a new project for your coregistered data products.<br>2. Open a product as the master and produce a subset of it for the desired area of interest.<br>3. Open the master product and from the GCP Manager enter a grid of evenly spaced GCPs.<br>4. Open a list of slave products which overlap the master area of interest.<br>5. From the Graph menu open the GCP Selection graph.<br>6. Drag and drop the master product from the project tree to the source entry of the Reader<br>7. Drag and drop the slave products from the project tree to the ProductSet Reader<br>8. Press Process to begin the GCP Selection graph<br>9. You may open the resulting GCP selected slave images and view/modify the GCPs that have been shifted in the slaves.<br><h4>Warp Application</h4><br>1. From the Graph menu open the Warp graph<br>2. Drag and drop the master product from the project tree to the source entry of the Reader<br>3. Drag and drop the gcp selected slave products from the project tree to the ProductSet Reader<br>4. Press Process to begin the Warp graph<br><br><br><br>
