<h3>Coregistering&nbsp;Products</h3>Images obtained from different
measurements may be co-registered such that the data is transformed
into one coordinate system. The toolbox will accurately co-register two
or more input images by spatial registration and resampling to correct
translational, rotational and scale differences. One of the images is
selected as the master image while the others are slave images.
Correlation metrics are used to automatically relate the slave images
to the master image. The input images need to have a minimum overlap.<br><br>NEST performs coregistration automatically by maximizing correlation in
windows around&nbsp;Ground Control Points (GCPs). This allows pixel-by-pixel comparisons of&nbsp;multiple datasets
that cover the same region.<br><br>Images
may be fully or only partly overlapping and may be from acquisitions
taken at different times using multiple sensors or from multiple
passages of the same satellite. &nbsp;The
slave and master images should be in the same projection.&nbsp; If not, the slave image(s) should be
reprojected into the same projection system as that of the master image.
<br>
<br>
Image co-registration is fundamental for Interferometry SAR (InSAR)
imaging and its applications, such as DEM map generation and analysis.
To obtain a high quality InSAR image, the individual complex images
need to be co-registered to sub-pixel accuracy. &nbsp;The achievable
co-registration accuracy for images in the same acquisition geometry
and over flat areas will be better than 0.2 pixels for two real images
and better than 0.05 pixels for two complex images.<br><br>
Coregistration is achieved in NEST using two graphs, one for GCP
Selection and the other to apply the Warp. The Warp graph requires that
all slave GCPs have been determined before evaluating the warp function.<br>
<br>
<h4>GCP Selection</h4>
The GCP Selection graph uses the <a href="../operators/CollocateOp.html">Collocate</a> and <a href="../operators/GCPSelectionOp.html">GCP Selection</a> operators.<br><br><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img style="width: 421px; height: 144px;" alt="gcp selection graph" src="images/gcp_selection_graph.jpg"><br></div><br>
1. Create a new project for your coregistered data products.<br>
2. Open a product as the master and produce a subset of it for the
desired area of interest.<br>
3. Open the master product and from the <a href="../visat/GcpManagement.html">GCP Manager</a> enter a grid of
evenly spaced GCPs and save the product.<br>
4. Open a list of slave products which overlap the master area of
interest.<br>
5. From the Graph menu open the GCP Selection graph.<br>
6. Drag and drop the master product from the project tree to the source
entry of the Reader<br>
7. Drag and drop the slave products from the project tree to the
ProductSet Reader<br>
8. Press Process to begin the GCP Selection graph<br>
9. You may open the resulting GCP selected slave images and view/modify
the GCPs that have been shifted in the slaves.<br>
<h4>Warp Application</h4>
The Warp graph uses the <a href="../operators/WarpOp.html">Warp</a> operator.<br><br><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img style="width: 364px; height: 139px;" alt="warp graph" src="images/warp_graph.jpg"><br></div><br>
1. From the Graph menu open the Warp graph<br>
2. Drag and drop the master product from the project tree to the source
entry of the Reader<br>
3. Drag and drop the gcp selected slave products from the project tree
to the ProductSet Reader<br>
4. Press Process to begin the Warp graph<br>
<br>
Note: Coregistration is currently only available for detected products.
Coregistration of complex products will be available in the next
release of the software.<br>
