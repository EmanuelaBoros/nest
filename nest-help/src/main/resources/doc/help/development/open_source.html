<h1>Open Source Development</h1>

<br>

The NEST software and full source code is distributed freely under the <a class="wiki" target="_blank" href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU GPL license</a>.
<br>
<br>

Open source makes software inherently independent of specific vendors, programmers and suppliers. The software<br>

can be freely distributed and shared by large communities including the source code and the right to modify it.<br>

This ensures that there isn&rsquo;t a single entity on which the future of the software depends on and allows for<br>

unlimited improvements and tuning of the quality and functionality of the software.
<br>
<br>
By making NEST open source, future evolution and growth of the toolbox
will be possible by the community of users and developers that
contribute back to the project.<br>
