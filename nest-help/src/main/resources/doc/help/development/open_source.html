<h1>Open Source Development</h1>

<br>

The NEST software and full source code is freely distributed&nbsp;under the <a class="wiki" target="_blank" href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU GPL license</a>.
<br>
<br>
Open source makes software inherently independent of specific vendors,
programmers and suppliers. The software can be freely distributed and
shared by large communities and includes the source code and the right
to modify it. This not only ensures that there isn&#8217;t a single entity on
which the future of the software depends, but also allows for unlimited
improvements and tuning of the quality and functionality of the
software.
<br>
<br>
By making NEST open source, future evolution and growth of the toolbox
will be possible by the community of users and developers that
contribute to the project.<br>
