<h3>General F.A.Q.</h3>
<h4>How is NEST licenced?</h4><p>NEST is licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU GPL</a><br></p><h4>If I write an application using NEST API am I forced to distribute that application?</h4><p>No.
The license gives you the option to distribute your application if you
want to. You do not have to exercise this option in the license.<br></p><h4>If I wanted to distribute an application using NEST what license would I need to use?</h4><p>The <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU GPL</a><br></p><h4>I am a commercial user. Is there any restriction on the use of NEST?</h4><p>NEST can be used internally ("in-house") without restriction, but only redistributed in other software that is under the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU GPL</a> unless permission is granted from all copyright holders. </p>
<h4>I can't open an ENVISAT product.</h4><p>First, try to open the products with Enviview <a href="http://earth.esa.int/enviview/"><font color="blue" size="3"><u>http://earth.esa.int/enviview/</u></font></a>.
If that works then it could be a version not supported by NEST. Let us
know and we'll try to get it supported asap. If both Enviview and NEST are
not able to read the product, then it could be that the file is corrupt
or compressed.&nbsp;</p><p>Some
users have had difficulty when decompressing files using Winzip.
Deactivate the CR/LF translation option in winzip (this option is
activated by default).</p><h4>What method is used for Oil Spill Detection?</h4><p>The
method currently implemented in NEST for oil spill detection is an
adaptive thresholding dark spots detection algorithm. It first
estimates the mean backscatter level in a large window, then set a
threshold which is k decibel below the estimated mean backscatter
level. Pixels with backscatter&nbsp; values lower than the threshold
are considered as potential oil spill. Finally the detected pixels are
clustered and discriminated. Only those clusters that are larger enough
will be saved as detection result. Here in the algorithm, the user has
fully control of the window size for estimating the mean backscatter
level, the parameter k for setting the threshold, and the minimum
cluster size.<br>&nbsp;<br>The method is based on the following
reference in which a much more complicated pyramid approach was
proposed. In NEST however one level detection is implemented.<br><br>&nbsp;A.
S. Solberg, C. Brekke and R. Solberg, "Algorithms for oil spill
detection in Radarsat and ENVISAT SAR images", Geoscience and Remote
Sensing Symposium, 2004. IGARSS '04. Proceedings. 2004 IEEE
International, 20-24 Sept. 2004, page 4909-4912, vol.7.</p><h4>Can I use the Apply-Orbit-File Operator on JERS-1, Radarsat-1. ALOS, etc.</h4><p>No.
The orbit corrections are only for ENVISAT, ERS-1 and ERS-2.&nbsp;If
the orbit state vectors in your products are not accurate then this
would be a problem when orthorectifying. You should be using the
SARSimulation Terrain Correction to coregister your image with a
simulated SAR image generated from the DEM and then terrain correcting.</p><h4>What external DEM does NEST support?</h4><p>Currently only WGS84-latlong

User can specify one tile (i.e. one file) of the DEM.</p><h4>What are the definitions of local incidence angle and projected local incidence angle?</h4><p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-GB"></span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-GB"></span></i><span style="font-size: 7pt; font-family: Symbol;" lang="EN-GB"></span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-GB"></span></i><span style="font-size: 7pt; font-family: Symbol;" lang="EN-GB"></span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-GB"></span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-GB"></span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;" lang="EN-GB"></span> The
local incidence angle is defined as the angle between the normal vector
of the backscattering element (i.e. vector perpendicular to the ground
surface) and the incoming radiation vector (i.e. vector formed by the
satellite position and the backscattering element position).</p><p>The projected local incidence angle is defined as the angle between the
incoming radiation vector (as defined above) and the projected surface
normal vector into range plane. Here range plane is the plane formed by
the satellite position, backscattering element position and the earth
center.</p><p>For
more information on the definitions, derivations and calculations of
the angles please see section 14.3.4 in "SAR Geocoding: Data and
Systems" by Gunter Schreier.</p><h4></h4><h4></h4><p></p>
