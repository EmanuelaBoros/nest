<h3>General F.A.Q.</h3>
<p></p>
<h4>I can't open an ENVISAT product.</h4><p>First, try to open the products with Enviview <a href="http://earth.esa.int/enviview/"><font color="blue" size="3"><u>http://earth.esa.int/enviview/</u></font></a>.
If that works then it could be a version not supported by NEST. Let us
know and we'll try to get it supported asap. If Enviview and NEST are
not able to read the product, then it could be that the file is corrupt
or compressed.&nbsp;</p><p>Some users have had difficulty when decompressing files using Winzip. Deactivate the CR/LF translation option in winzip (this option is activated by default).</p>
