<h3>General F.A.Q.</h3>
<p></p>
<h4>I can't open an ENVISAT product.</h4><p>First, try to open the products with Enviview <a href="http://earth.esa.int/enviview/"><font color="blue" size="3"><u>http://earth.esa.int/enviview/</u></font></a>.
If that works then it could be a version not supported by NEST. Let us
know and we'll try to get it supported asap. If Enviview and NEST are
not able to read the product, then it could be that the file is corrupt
or compressed.&nbsp;</p><p>Some
users have had difficulty when decompressing files using Winzip.
Deactivate the CR/LF translation option in winzip (this option is
activated by default).</p><h4>What method is used for Oil Spill Detection?</h4><p>The
method currently implemented in NEST for oil spill detection is an
adaptive thresholding dark spots detection algorithm. It first
estimates the mean backscatter level in a large window, then set a
threshold which is k decibel below the estimated mean backscatter
level. Pixels with backscatter&nbsp; values lower than the threshold
are considered as potential oil spill. Finally the detected pixels are
clustered and discriminated. Only those clusters that are larger enough
will be saved as detection result. Here in the algorithm, the user has
fully control of the window size for estimating the mean backscatter
level, the parameter k for setting the threshold, and the minimum
cluster size.<br>&nbsp;<br>The method is based on the following
reference in which a much more complicated pyramid approach was
proposed. In NEST however one level detection is implemented.<br><br>&nbsp;A.
