<h3>Installation F.A.Q.</h3>
<p></p><h4>What is the minimum required hardware to run NEST</h4><p>It is recommended to have at least 2GB of memory. NEST can work with only 1GB but may run slower.</p><p>To run the 3D WorldWind View, it is recommended to have a 3D graphics card with updated drivers.</p><p>NEST has been tested to work on 32 and 64 bit Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7 and Linux.</p><h4>I can't start up the DAT</h4><p>Try
running from the command line to see any errors using dat.bat on
Windows or dat.sh on Linux. If the error mentions something to do with
any of "WorldWind, native library, JOGL, glugen, or OpenGL" then it may be a problem with WorldWind:</p><p>Try first to update your drivers (<a class="wiki external" target="_blank" href="http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/java/video.html" rel="external">How to update windows drivers</a>) (<a class="wiki external" target="_blank" href="http://ati.amd.com/support/driver.html" rel="external">ATI/AMD</a> - <a class="wiki external" target="_blank" href="http://www.nvidia.com/content/drivers/drivers.asp" rel="external">Nvidia</a> - <a class="wiki external" target="_blank" href="http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/index.htm" rel="external">Intel</a>)</p><p>If
that doesn't work, then try removing WorldWind by deleting the file
from your NEST installation folder
NEST3B/modules/nest-world-wind-view-3B.jar</p><h4>How can I get WorldWind to work? I see a blank window in the World View.</h4><p>To use the new WorldWind World Map and 3D View, a 3D video card with updated drivers is necessary.<br>
Update your video card drivers. (<a class="wiki external" target="_blank" href="http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/java/video.html" rel="external">How to update windows drivers</a>) (<a class="wiki external" target="_blank" href="http://ati.amd.com/support/driver.html" rel="external">ATI/AMD</a> - <a class="wiki external" target="_blank" href="http://www.nvidia.com/content/drivers/drivers.asp" rel="external">Nvidia</a> - <a class="wiki external" target="_blank" href="http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/index.htm" rel="external">Intel</a>)</p><h4>The installer is not working for me</h4><p>Try downloading the Java binary version of NEST. It is simply a zipped folder without an installer.</p><p>If you would like to run he gpt from any folder, you will need to set the NEST_HOME path to where ever you unzip it.</p><p>For example on Windows go to Control Panel -&gt; System -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Evironment Variables</p><p><img style="width: 384px; height: 434px;" alt="" src="images/win_env_var.jpg"></p><p>Add a variable for NEST_HOME to point to the installation folder and also include %NEST_HOME% in the PATH variable.</p><p>On Linux,&nbsp;set these environment variables in .profile or .bash_profile in your home directory<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; export NEST_HOME=installation folder<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; export PATH=$PATH:$NEST_HOME</p><p>Then either restart your terminal or type </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source ~/.bashrc</p><p>Also, make sure the paths in NEST3B/config/settings.xml are appropriate for your file system.</p><h4>I only have 1Gb of RAM. How can I run NEST without running out of memory?</h4><p>Try reducing the tile size in the settings dialog to 200. From the main menu go to Edit -&gt; Settings.</p><h4>How can I improve performance</h4><p>Performance in NEST drops considerably when using virtual memory. If you have more than 2Gb of RAM and wish to use all of it, on
a 64-bit OS you should be using a 64-bit version of Java. You may then
set the heap size for the Java virtual machine to something larger such
as -Xmx4096M</p><p>To
do so, open in a text editor your gpt.bat on Windows or gpt.sh on Linux found in your NEST installation folder
and replace the -Xmx1024M value with something larger like -Xmx4096M.
You may do the same with dat.bat or dat.sh.</p><p>For Windows64, the 64-bit Windows version of NEST should already come with 64-bit Java and be ready for use.</p><p></p>
