/**
 * The main purpose of this package is to provide a simple data binding framework for binding
 * Java objects to a GUI or a DOM.
 * <p>Basically it also provides support for the <i>Property List</i> and <i>Value Object</i>
 * design patterns (see {@link PropertyContainer} and {@link Property}).</p>
 * <p>This package and its sub-packages currently form a self-standing API which is
 * not used by <i>Ceres</i> itself.</p>
 * <p>An important entry point into this API may be the {@link PropertyContainer} class, which
 * is used to manage a collection {@link Property}s whose values may originate from
 * diverse sources.</p>

 * @since Ceres 0.6
