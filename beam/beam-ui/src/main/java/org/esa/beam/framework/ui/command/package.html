<BODY>

<p>This package provides an implementation of the GoF 'Command Pattern'
for the MERIS/(A)ATSR Toolbox.

<P>This implementation of the command pattern
<LD>
  <LI>separates application logic from GUI code,</LI>
  <LI>builds upon the Swing Action Architecture, but command code is executed in separate command listeners,</LI>
  <LI>provides commands, checked commands and command groups</LI>
  <LI>provides automatic menu registration:
    <LD>
      <LI>ordinary commands create ordinary menu items,</LI>
      <LI>checked commands create check-box menu items,</LI>
      <LI>command groups create sub-menus</LI>
    </LD>
  </LI>
  <LI>provides all properties that a Swing <code>Action</code> can have plus the 'checked' property</LI>
  <LI>provides context dependend popup-menu registration (not implemented yet)</LI>
  <LI>uses command constraints to decide where (parent/location) and when (context dependent) a command appears in the GUI</LI>
  <LI>enables tracking of which commands have been performed,</LI>
  <LI>eases the implementation of undo/redo capabilities (in the future)</LI>
</LD>
