This package contains example code for reading and exporting data from different
data sources within a data product. The input data products can either have
ENVISAT or BEAM-DIMAP format.

<p>Currently three examples are provided:
<ol>
   <li>{@link org.esa.beam.examples.data_export.BandWriterMain} is a command-line tool which can be used to export bands
        from a product.  The example code shows you how to read and write specific bands
        in their native data format.
   </li>
   <li>{@link org.esa.beam.examples.data_export.TiePointGridWriterMain} is a command-line tool which can be used to export
     tie-piont grids from a product. The example code shows you how to read and write
     specific tie-point grids interpolated into the product's scene raster co-ordinates.
   </li>
   <li>{@link org.esa.beam.examples.data_export.BitmaskWriterMain} is a command-line tool which can be used to export
       bit-mask images computed from arbitrarily formed bit-mask expressions.
      The example code shows you how to read a bit-mask from a product using a pre-compiled
      bit-mask expression which can contain references to multiple flag datasets at the
      same time.
   </li>
</ol>
