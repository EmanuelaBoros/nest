 * 
 * <p>
 * Such an {@link ImageOutputStream} internally uses an
 * {@link EnhancedRandomAccessFile} which basically is a
 * {@link RandomAccessFile} with buffering.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Overall performance is improved with respect to simple
 * {@link FileImageOutputStream}. Some simplicistic tests showed that
 * performances are close to the performances of the
 * {@link FileChannelImageOutputStream} but without the burden of using
 * {@link FileChannel} which on some platform with some older versions of Java
 * can be problematic.
