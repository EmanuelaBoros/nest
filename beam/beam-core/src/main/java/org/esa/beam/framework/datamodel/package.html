<BODY bgColor=white>

This package contains classes and interfaces used for an in-memory presentation
of remote sensing data products.

<p>The {@link org.esa.beam.framework.datamodel.Product} class plays a central role in this package and is used
throughout the MERIS/(A)ATSR software in order represent data products of
many different types.

<p>Many of the classes in this package are superclasses of the {@link org.esa.beam.framework.datamodel.ProductNode},
which acts as a base class for all data and metadata items contained in a product.
The inheritance hierarchy is as follows:

<dir>
    <li>{@link org.esa.beam.framework.datamodel.ProductNode}</li>
    <dir>
        <li>{@link org.esa.beam.framework.datamodel.MetadataElement}</li>
        <dir>
            <li>{@link org.esa.beam.framework.datamodel.FlagCoding}</li>
        </dir>
        <li>{@link org.esa.beam.framework.datamodel.DataNode}</li>
        <dir>
            <dir>
                <li>{@link org.esa.beam.framework.datamodel.MetadataAttribute}</li>
            </dir>
            <li>{@link org.esa.beam.framework.datamodel.RasterDataNode}</li>
            <dir>
                <li>{@link org.esa.beam.framework.datamodel.TiePointGrid}</li>
                <li>{@link org.esa.beam.framework.datamodel.Band}</li>
            </dir>
        </dir>
    <li>{@link org.esa.beam.framework.datamodel.Product <b>Product</b>}</li>
</dir>


<p>A strongly related package is {@link org.esa.beam.framework.dataio} which provides
the data product I/O framework.
