This package contains interfaces and classes used for the implemenation of
cartographic map projections. The package has three very important classes.
<ld>
<li>The class {@link org.esa.beam.framework.dataop.maptransf.MapProjection} is used to represent
    a specific parameterized prjection.
<li>the interface {@link org.esa.beam.framework.dataop.maptransf.MapTransform} provides the mathematical algorithm for
    the transformation and
<li>the {@link org.esa.beam.framework.dataop.maptransf.MapInfo} class holds information required to bring the map co-ordinate
    system to an image raster co-ordinate system.
