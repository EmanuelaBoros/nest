    The main package of the JEXP API. It defines the abstract
    <code>{@link Term com.bc.jexp.Term}</code> class which plays a central role in the API.
    The other interfaces and classes in this package just support <code>Term</code>.
    The <code>Term</code> class is used to represent the parsed expressions in memory
    and also to evaluate them.
