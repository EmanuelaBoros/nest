<h3>Export GeoTIFF Product</h3>

<!-- TODO: REMOVE for BEAM 4.7 FINAL-->
<hr>
<b >NOTE:</b><br>
<p class="inote">
    Please note that the export of a product to a GeoTIFF file will not work with the BEAM 4.7 PREVIEW release.<br>
    This issue will be addressed for the final BEAM 4.7 release.  
</p>
<hr>
<br>


<p>This command allows to export the data of the current product to GeoTIFF file.</p>

<p>GeoTIFF is an extension to the TIFF 6.0 specification. These image files contain
    additional information about thier georeference and their spatial resolution. A wide range of
    projected coordinate systems are supported including UTM, US State Plane, and National Grids.
    For further information have a look at the following documentations:
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://trac.osgeo.org/geotiff/">GeoTIFF Homepage</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/tiff/index.html">TIFF Specification</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Constraints of created GeoTIFF product files</h3>

<p>The exported GeoTIFF files contain additional information beside the tags defined by the GeoTIFF specification.
    This BEAM-DIMAP header is used to these additional informations. This allows a better support of several BEAM
    features.<br/>
    This includes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Name and type of the product.</li>
    <li>Name, description and unit of each band.</li>
    <li>The properties of no-data and scaling for each band.</li>
    <li>The index coding of a band.</li>
    <li>Virtual and filtered bands.</li>
    <li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    For features and limitations of the GeoTIFF export and constraints of interaction with other GIS tools please see
    the following list:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>All bands of a GeoTiff file must have the same data type. Therefor a common data type is identified which
        fits for all bands. Double precision data type is not supported.
    </li>
    <li>The data of a band is always written raw and unscaled.
    </li>
    <li>Virtual and filtered bands can only be reimported by BEAM.</li>
    <li>All <a href="../general/MapProjTable.html">projections available in BEAM</a> are also supported by the GeoTIFF
        writer.
        As a fallback, if a map projection or other geocoding is not directly supported a tie-point grid is written to
        the GeoTiff file.<br/>
        The exported GeoTiff files were tested for compatibility with ENVI and ArcGis. While the files are fully
        compatible with ENVI, ArcGIS has problems to understand stereographic projections.
    </li>
    <li>An index coded band can only be correctly decoded by other GIS tools, if it is written as an image with one
        band.
    </li>
</ul>
