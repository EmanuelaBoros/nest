Usage:
  {0} <op>|<graph-file> [options] [<source-file-1> <source-file-2> ...]

Description:
  This tool is used to execute raster data operators in batch-mode.
  The operators can be used stand-alone or combined as a directed acyclic
  graph (DAG). Processing graphs are represented using XML. More info
  about processing graphs, the operator API, and the graph XML format can
  be found in the documentation.

Arguments:
  <op>               Name of an operator. See below for the list of <op>s.
  <graph-file>       Operator graph file (XML format).
  <source-file-i>    The <i>th source product file. The actual number of
                     source file arguments is specified by <op>. May be
                     optional for operators which use the '-S' option.

Options:
  -h                 Displays command usage. If <op> is given, the specific
                     operator usage is displayed.
  -t <file>          The target file. Default value is ''{1}''.
  -c <cache-size>    Sets the tile cache size in bytes. Must be greater zero
                     and less than maximum available heap space.
                     Value can be suffixed with ''K'', ''M'' and ''G''.
  -f <format>        Output file format, e.g. ''GeoTIFF'', ''HDF5'',
                     ''BEAM-DIMAP''. If not specified, format will be
                     derived from the target filename extension, if any,
                     otherwise the default format is ''{2}''.
  -p <file>          A (Java Properties) file containing processing
                     parameters in the form <name>=<value>.
  -T<target>=<file>  Defines a target product. Valid for graphs only.
                     <target> must be the identifier of a node in the graph.
                     The node''s output will be written to <file>.
  -S<source>=<file>  Defines a source product. <source> is specified by
                     the operator or the graph. In an XML graph, all
                     occurences of $'{<source>'} will be replaced with
                     references to a source product located at <file>.
  -P<name>=<value>   Defines a processing parameter, <name> is specified by
                     the operator or the graph. In an XML graph, all
                     occurences of $'{<name>'} will be replaced with <value>.
                     Overwrites parameter values specified by the ''-p''
                     option.
  -e                 Displays Java stack trace, if an error occurs.
