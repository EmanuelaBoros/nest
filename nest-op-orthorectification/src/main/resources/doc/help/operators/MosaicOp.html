<h3>Mosaic Operator</h3>
<p> The Mosaic Operator combines overlapping products into a single composite product.
&nbsp;The mosaicking is achieved based on the geocoding of the source
products therefore the geocoding needs to be very accurate. It is
recommended that the source products be Terrain Corrected and
Radiometric Corrected first.</p>

<p>The following
parameters are used by the Operator:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p> Source Bands: All bands (real or virtual) of the source
product. You may
select one or more bands. If no bands are
selected, then by default all bands will be processed.</p></li><li><p>Resampling Method: Choice of Nearest Neighbour, Bilinear or Cubic resampling.</p></li><li><p>Map Projection: You can select one of the supported map
projections here. For
a description of the available map-projections, please refer to the
chapter <i><a href="../general/MapProjTable.html">Available
Map Projections</a></i>.</p></li><li>The output Scene Width and Height in pixels</li><li>Averaging and normalization options to blend overlapping pixels.</li>

</ol>
<br><p>Below is an example of a mosaic of ASA_GM1 products that have
been Terrain Corrected and Radiometric Corrected. Overlapping areas
have been&nbsp;normalized and averaged.&nbsp;</p><p><img style="width: 1117px; height: 781px;" alt="" src="images/mosaic_australia.jpg"></p>
