        <h3>Otsu Thresholding Method</h3>

        <p>This plugin implements the Otsu thresholding method for image processing 
            and it was ported from 
            the open source library <a href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html">ImageJ</a>.</p>

        <p>The histogram is divided in two classes and the inter-class variance is minimized. 
        This plugin outputs a thresholded image with the selected threshold
        applied on the entire image. The between class variance is computed and 
        the threshold with the maximum between class variance also has the 
        minimum within class variance,used for finding 
        the best threshold in a simpler and better approach.</p>

        <b>Parameters Used</b><br>
        For most filters, the following parameter should be selected:
        <ol>
            <li><b>Source Band:</b> All bands (real or virtual) of the source product. 
                User can select one or more bands 
                for producing thresholded images. If no bands are selected, then by default all bands will be selected. 
                For complex product, only the intensity band can be selected.</li>
        </ol>
