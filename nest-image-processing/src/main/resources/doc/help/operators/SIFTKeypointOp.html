        <h3>Data Analysis Operator</h3><p>
        <p>This plugin implements the extraction of Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)
            features from SAR images and it was ported from 
            the open source library <a href="http://www.openimaj.org/">OpenImaJ</a>.</p>
        <br>
        <b>Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)</b> is an image descriptor for image-based matching 
        developed by David Lowe ([1], [2]). This descriptor as well as related image descriptors 
        are used for a large number of purposes in computer vision related to point matching between 
        different views of a 3-D scene and view-based object recognition. The SIFT descriptor is invariant 
        to translations, rotations and scaling transformations in the image domain and robust to moderate 
        perspective transformations and illumination variations. Experimentally, the SIFT descriptor has 
        been proven to be very useful in practice for image matching and object recognition under real-world 
        conditions. 
        <b>Parameters Used</b><br>
        For most filters, the following parameters should be selected (see Figure 1 for example):
        <ol>
            <li><b>Source Band:</b> All bands (real or virtual) of the source product. User can select one or more bands 
                for producing filtered images. If no bands are selected, then by default all bands will be selected. 
                For complex product, only the intensity band can be selected.</li>
        </ol>
