        <h3>Maximum Entropy Thresholding Method</h3>

        <p>This plugin does automatic thresholding based on the entropy of the histogram. 
            The method is very similar to Otsu's method. Rather than maximizing the inter-class variance, 
            it maximizes the inter-class entropy. Entropy is a measure of the uncertainty of an event 
            taking place. You can calculate it as: S = -(sum)p*log2(p) so it is very straightforward 
            to do using the histogram data. (p is the probability of a pixel greyscale value in the image, 
            and (sum) is the sigma. It is customary to use log in base 2.

        <b>Parameters Used</b><br>
        For most filters, the following parameters should be selected:
        <ol>
            <li><b>Source Band:</b> All bands (real or virtual) of the source product. User can select one or more bands 
                for producing thresholded images. If no bands are selected, then by default all bands will be selected. 
                For complex product, only the intensity band can be selected.</li>
        </ol>
