        <h3>Morphology Operators</h3>

        <p>This plugin implements the basic morphological operators for image processing, 
            dilation, erosion, opening, closing and it was ported from 
            the open source library <a href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html">ImageJ</a>.</p>

        <b>Parameters Used</b><br>
        For most filters, the following parameters should be selected (see Figure 1 for example):
        <ol>
            <li><b>Source Band:</b> All bands (real or virtual) of the source product. User can select one or more bands 
                for producing filtered images. If no bands are selected, then by default all bands will be selected. 
                For complex product, only the intensity band can be selected.</li>
            <li><b>Morphology Operator:</b> Dilate, Erode, Open, Close</li>
            <li><b>Iterations:</b> How many times the operator will be applied</li>
        </ol>

        <p><b>Dilate:</b> The basic effect of the operator on a binary image is to gradually enlarge 
            the boundaries of regions of foreground pixels (i.e. white pixels, typically). Thus areas 
            of foreground pixels grow in size while holes within those regions become smaller.</p>

        <p><b>Erode:</b> The basic effect of the operator on a binary image is to erode away the boundaries 
            of regions of foreground pixels (i.e. white pixels, typically). Thus areas of foreground pixels 
            shrink in size, and holes within those areas become larger.  </p>

        Figure 1. Erode Operator

        <p><b>Open:</b> The basic effect of an opening is somewhat like erosion in that it tends to remove 
            some of the foreground (bright) pixels from the edges of regions of foreground pixels. However 
            it is less destructive than erosion in general. As with other morphological operators, the exact 
            operation is determined by a structuring element. The effect of the operator is to preserve 
            foreground regions that have a similar shape to this structuring element, or that can completely 
            contain the structuring element, while eliminating all other regions of foreground pixels.</p>
        <br><img width="510" height="250" alt="" src="images/Open.png"><br>
        Figure 1. Open Operator

        <p><b>Close:</b> Closing is similar in some ways to dilation in that it tends to enlarge the boundaries 
            of foreground (bright) regions in an image (and shrink background color holes in such regions), 
            but it is less destructive of the original boundary shape. As with other morphological operators, 
            the exact operation is determined by a structuring element. The effect of the operator is to 
            preserve background regions that have a similar shape to this structuring element, or that can 
            completely contain the structuring element, while eliminating all other regions of background pixels.</p>
