<h3>Export Transect Pixels </h3>
<p>This command allows the export of pixel values along the
current transect as tab-separated values. This is convenient for
further use in spreadsheets, e.g. Microsoft® Excel. A transect can be
defined by arbitrary shape figures drawn into an image. You can also
import a transect using the <a href="../readers/ImportTransectData.html">Import Transect
Data</a> command.
</p>
<p>The command is similar to <a href="ExportROIPixels.html">Export
ROI pixels</a> and also the export format is identical.
</p>
<p>The "Copy to Clipboard" option will copy the transect pixel
values to the clipboard. This may take a few moments, depending on the
number of pixels.</p>
<p>The "Write to File" option brings up a file selection dialog
to select the destination directory and to assign a name to the text
file. The written file may easily be imported with any text editor or
spreadsheet software. </p>
<p class="inote">Note: In low memory situations, it may be
a better to export to a file instead of copying to the clipboard.</p>
