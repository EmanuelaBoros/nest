<h3>Product Subset Definition</h3>

<p>This dialog appears from various import and export file selection dialogs and
    always if a new product has to be created from a base product, such as in
    the map projection or band arithmetic dialogs.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/SubsetDialog.jpg"><br>
</p>

<p>The dialog is divided into four tabs, each providing specific subset options.<br>

</p><h4>Spatial Subset</h4>

<p>If you are not interested in the whole image, you may specify an area
    of the product to be loaded. You can select the area either by dragging the blue
    surrounding rectangle in the preview (see figure above) or by editing the appropriate
    fields. If you drag the rectangle, the field values change simultaneously. <br>
    You can also specify a sub-sampling, by setting the values of
    <code>Scene step X</code> and <code>Scene step Y</code>.
</p>

<h4>Band Subset</h4>

<p>This tab is used to select the bands you want to have in your product subset.</p>

<h4>Tie-Point Grid Subset</h4>

<p>As with bands, this tab is used to select the tie-point grids you want to have in your product subset.
    The tie-point grids named <code>latitude</code> and <code>longitude</code> can not be deselected
    because they provide essential geo-coding information.</p>

<h4>Metadata Subset</h4>

<p>The tab lets you select/deselect meta-data records and tables. By default, all meta-data tables are deselected,
    because they can be very huge for <a href="../general/ENVISAT-products/index.html">ENVISAT products</a> and may reduce
    DAT's performance.</p>
